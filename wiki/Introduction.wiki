= Introduction =

EDAMS is a Linux application to allow house domotics handling. EDAMS have nice but efficients user interfaces to improve your's domotics experience.

EDAMS support:

  * xPL protocol
  * Data handling via Cosm.com(ex-pachube.com)
  * Location handling with geolocalization service.
  * Widgets to show your device's data in a nice way.
  * Global device's map to show your devices in one touch with the ability to move gadgets anywhere on the map.
  * Data graphics generated from gnuplot and showed in global map.
  * Actions(scenario-like) to perfoms some predefined actions on some condition(send a mail when temperature is >= 13, light on led bulb when night occurs...).

To use EDAMS, you'll needs:

  * EFLs http://www.enlightenment.org
  * xPL HUB http://www.xpl4java.org/xPL4Linux/ oe https://github.com/beanz/xpl-perl/

See your own distribution manager for these package, they should be available. Currently, EDAMS isn't available in a packaging version, you'll need to do the following step:

  * svn checkout http://edams.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ edams-read-only
  * cd edams-read-only
  * sh autogen.sh
  * make
  * sudo make install

For hardware parts, its depends of your xPL networks. In my house, I'm using:
  * Arduino
  * Arduino xPL library to make my own xPL devices: http://connectingstuff.net/blog/xpl-arduino/
